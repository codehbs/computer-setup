# Computer Set-Up Instructions
Let's get your dev environment set up! This guide is inspired by the one that DevBootcamp used for its new students in 2015. Learn more about [DevBootcamp's program](https://github.com/Devbootcamp).

If you're not familiar with the command line, you may want to start by reading *Learning the Bash Shell* [Chapter 1](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/learning-the-bash/0596009658/ch01.html). Try the [Command Line Crash Course](https://www.vikingcodeschool.com/web-development-basics/a-command-line-crash-course) from Viking Code School to get some practice using the command line.

Setting up your computer can be tricky, and there are specific technologies we will need you to develop on your personal computer. DevBootcamp created instructions for installing each of these in Linux, Mac, and Windows. If you are using Windows, the principles should be similar to what was described in *Learning the Bash Shell,* but not exactly the same.

If you have already set up your computer with a dev environment, please make sure you have each of the necessary technologies installed.

NOTE: These instructions assume you have a "clean" environment and don't have anything funky going on in your system. It should go smoothly if you start with a clean slate, but it may take significantly more time if you have set up a dev environment before. Also, some of the commands will change the way your terminal and sublime look, so be prepared for that. You can always change it back if you would prefer. If you install the dotfiles, it will change your path and overwrite any manual configurations you had.

If you run into installation problems, please join our weekly CODE meetings to ask questions. Our members are not experts at computer set up, that is a different skill, but they should help you at least google your way to a solution. Due to the many differences in environments, it's impossible to create perfect instructions for everyone.

- [Mac](mac-instructions.md)
- [Windows](windows-instructions.md)**

**Few members at CODE can provide support for Windows beyond these instructions. If students are interested in learning about how to use a different shell, the learning for that is up to them. CODE members have the most experience with Mac.
